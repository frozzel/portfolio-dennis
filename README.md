## Overview

Welcome to the Dennis Hickox's Portfolio repository! This project is built using the MERN stack, a powerful set of technologies that enables seamless development of full-stack web applications. Here's a brief overview to help you understand the core components and functionality of this project.

## Features

- User Authentication: Secure user sign-up, login, and authentication mechanisms are in place using JWT and OAuth.
- RESTful API: The application features a comprehensive set of RESTful endpoints for CRUD operations, ensuring smooth data interaction between the front and back ends.
- State Management: Implemented using React's Context API (or Redux if specified), ensuring efficient state management across components.
- Responsive Design: The UI is designed to be responsive and mobile-friendly, providing an optimal viewing experience across different devices.
- Error Handling: Robust error handling processes throughout the application to enhance reliability and user experience.
- Scalability: The project structure and technologies have been chosen and configured to support future growth and scalability.

## Technologies Used

- MongoDB: As our database solution, MongoDB allows us to store data in a flexible, JSON-like format, which is ideal for handling the dynamic needs of modern applications.
- Express.js: This robust web application framework for Node.js provides a set of features to build single-page, multi-page, and hybrid web applications efficiently.
- React: Our front-end is developed using React, a JavaScript library that enables the building of interactive user interfaces with reusable components.
- Node.js: The server-side runtime environment executes JavaScript code, allowing us to build scalable network applications.
